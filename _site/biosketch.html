            I earned her M.S. in Bioinformatics and PhD in Biochemistry (interdisciplinary) from <a href="https://williams.chemistry.gatech.edu"> Georgia Tech, Atlanta</a>. My PhD dissertation work was a combination of computational and experimental approaches for 3D pattern recognition and datamining and the biochemical relevance of these structures to function in RNA, DNA and protein molecules. My work showed that RNA uses similar geometries to stabilize seemingly divergent 3D motifs, suggesting that a subset of structural building blocks combine to form complex tertiary 3D shapes.

        </p>
        <p class="custom-text">
            As a postdoctoral scientist in <a href="http://rna.ucsc.edu/rnacenter/noller_lab.html">Prof. Harry Noller's lab at UC Santa Cruz</a>, I developed innovative computational pattern recognition and 3D motion quantification tools for large databases of macromolecular dynamics and published my work in high impact journals. I showed that dimensionality reduction strategies and statistical correlations can help manage large volumes of data. By correlating with biological relevance, my work help identify a novel mechanism of motion in the highly conserved ribosome (the molecule that universally translates mRNA to protein). This work also showed how the antibiotic spectinomycin stalls bacterial ribosome function.  See <a href="section-one.html" class="custom-text">Deep Dive</a> for more details.
            In my leadership role as the chair of the <a href="https://sciencepostdocs.sites.ucsc.edu/"> UCSC </a> Postdocs Association, I implemented new platforms for scientific exchange and socialization among postdocs and the UCSC community, organized multiple workshops throughout the year, including the UCSC Annual Postdoc Symposium in 2017.
        </p>
        <p class="custom-text"> Over my academic career, I helped develop novel complexity reduction computational tools to organize, analyze, and visualize large biomolecular datasets. I built predictive models to address structure-function relationships. I have published high-impact peer-reviewed articles and have presented my work at multiple national and international conferences including the RNA Society Meeting, Ribosomes, American Chemical Society.  I have also mentored multiple undergraduate and graduate students in computational biology projects.
        </p>
        <h4 class="custom-text" style="text-align: left;"><em><b>Industry Experience </b></em></h4>
        <p class="custom-text">
            I worked at Thermo Fisher Scientific as a Staff Scientist Bioinformatics for their <a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/microarray-analysis.html">Microarray Business Unit</a>  (formerly Affymetrix),  where I led the bioinformatics for a prenatal screening assay. I worked on projects relating to better detection of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and alpha-thalassemia gene (HBA) variations. I contributed to multiple bioinformatics projects related to precision medicine and carrier screening assays. I am a co-author on a patent application for a novel SMA detection algorithm. I have presented my work on SMA and HBA at multiple international conferences.

            A few years later, I was recruited to Cepheid to build out their newly formed bioinformatics group where I set up sequence databases and built pipelines for reproducibility. I helped develop the strategy around a highly multiplexed IVD assay.

            <p>My industry experience helped develop an intution for data quality when building assays for customer use, while collaborating with large matrixed groups within the company. I leveraged machine learning and statistical algorithms for data analysis and outlier prediction, all of which helped improve accuracy, reproducibility and output.

       <h4 class="custom-text" style="text-align: left;"><em><b>Helixa.bio </b></em></h4>
       <p class="custom-text">
           I founded Helixa.bio to leverage my unique intersection of expertise applying ML and bioinformatics for multiomic and multimodal data, with a strong understanding of the underlying biology. I work closely with early-stage biotech founders to bridge the gap between raw data and real-world impact. With a deep understanding of both biology and code, I build tools to support informed decisions, and investor-ready insights.

       </p>
       <h4 class="custom-text" style="text-align: left;"><em><b>Professional Affiliations </b></em></h4>
       <p class="custom-text">
           I am a City lead for the <a href="https://www.bitsinbio.org">Bits in Bio</a> SD chapter where I organize events and workshops to foster learning and collaboration in the AIxML community. I also volunteer as a mentor for various professional groups in CA.
