            I earned her M.S. in Bioinformatics and PhD in Biochemistry (interdisciplinary) from <a href="https://williams.chemistry.gatech.edu"> Georgia Tech, Atlanta</a>. My PhD dissertation work was a combination of computational and experimental approaches for 3D pattern recognition and datamining and the biochemical relevance of these structures to function in RNA, DNA and protein molecules. My work showed that RNA uses similar geometries to stabilize seemingly divergent 3D motifs, suggesting that a subset of structural building blocks combine to form complex tertiary 3D shapes.

            As a postdoctoral scientist in <a href="http://rna.ucsc.edu/rnacenter/noller_lab.html">Prof. Harry Noller's lab at UC Santa Cruz</a>, I developed innovative computational pattern recognition and 3D motion quantification tools for large databases of macromolecular dynamics and published my work in high impact journals. I showed that dimensionality reduction strategies and statistical correlations can help manage large volumes of data. By correlating with biological relevance, my work help identify a novel mechanism of motion in the highly conserved ribosome (the molecule that universally translates mRNA to protein). This work also showed how the antibiotic spectinomycin stalls bacterial ribosome function.  See <a href="section-one.html" class="custom-text">Deep Dive</a> for more details.
            In my leadership role as the chair of the <a href="https://sciencepostdocs.sites.ucsc.edu/"> UCSC </a> Postdocs Association, I implemented new platforms for scientific exchange and socialization among postdocs and the UCSC community, organized multiple workshops throughout the year, including the UCSC Annual Postdoc Symposium in 2017.

        <h4 class="custom-text" style="text-align: left;"><em><b>Industry Experience </b></em></h4>
        <p class="custom-text">
            I worked at Thermo Fisher Scientific as a Staff Scientist Bioinformatics for their <a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/microarray-analysis.html">Microarray Business Unit</a>  (formerly Affymetrix),  I lead the bioinformatics for a prenatal test and I worked on multiple projects relating to better detection of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and alpha-thalassemia gene (HBA) variations. I contributed to multiple bioinformatics projects related to precision medicine and carrier screening assays. I am a co-author on a patent application for a novel SMA detection algorithm. I have presented my work on SMA and HBA at multiple international conferences.

            A few years later, I was recruited to Cepheid to build out their newly formed bioinformatics group where I set up sequence databases and built pipelines for reproducibility. I helped develop the strategy around a highly multiplexed IVD assay.

       <h4 class="custom-text" style="text-align: left;"><em><b>Helixa.bio </b></em></h4>
       <p class="custom-text">
           I founded Helixa.bio to provide data science and bioinformatics technical consulting services to early-stage biotech companies. My experiences span multiple domains including genomics, bioinformatics, structural biology and RNA biochemistry, and extensive experience developing reproducible software - a rare combination of skills that I leverage to help companies build robust data analysis pipelines and ML/AI platforms with the underlying biology in mind.
