             I am deeply passionate about developing quantitative approaches to better understand and advance the fields of diagnostics and precision medicine.
             I am the founder of Helixa.bio - a data science company focused on the intersection of biochemistry and machine learning. I work with companies as a technical consultant to strategize and build bioinformatics and data analysis pipelines, ML/AI platforms, and critically evaluate projects.
             I am an advisor for the California Life Sciences FAST program, through which I work with early-stage companies to develop their product and business strategies.

            I earned her M.S. in Bioinformatics and PhD in Biochemistry (interdisciplinary) from Georgia Tech, Atlanta. My PhD dissertation work was a combination of computational and experimental approaches for 3D pattern recognition and datamining and the biochemical relevance of these structures to function in RNA, DNA and protein molecules. My work showed that RNA uses similar geometries to stabilize seemingly divergent 3D motifs, suggesting that a subset of structural building blocks combine to form complex tertiary 3D shapes.

            As a postdoctoral scientist in Prof. Harry Noller's lab, I developed innovative computational pattern recognition and 3D motion quantification tools for large databases of macromolecular dynamics and published my work in high impact journals. I showed that dimensionality reduction strategies and statistical correlations can help manage large volumes of data. By correlating with biological relevance, my work help identify a novel mechanism of motion in the highly conserved ribosome (the molecule that universally translates mRNA to protein). This work also showed how the antibiotic spectinomycin stalls bacterial ribosome function.  See <a href="section-one.html" class="custom-text">here</a> for more details. In my leadership role as the chair of the <a href="https://sciencepostdocs.sites.ucsc.edu/">UCSC</a> UCSC Postdocs Association, I implemented new platforms for scientific exchange and socialization among postdocs and the UCSC community, organized multiple workshops throughout the year, including the UCSC Annual Postdoc Symposium in 2017.

            In my industry role at Thermo Fisher Scientific, I contributed to multiple bioinformatics projects related to precision medicine and carrier screening assays. I am a co-author on a patent application for a novel spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) detection algorithm. I lead the bioinformatics for a prenatal test and I worked on multiple projects relating to better detection of alpha-thalassemia gene (HBA) variations. I presented my work on SMA and HBA at multiple international conferences.

            I work with start-ups in the biotech industry as a technical data science consultant and an advisor. I am passionate about mentoring young scientists and fostering diversity in STEM fields. I have participated in numerous outreach programs aimed at encouraging underrepresented groups to pursue careers in science and technology.
